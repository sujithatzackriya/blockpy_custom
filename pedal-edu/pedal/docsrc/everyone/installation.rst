Installation
============

Pedal was designed to be a pure Python module, without any external
dependencies outside of the Python standard library.
The library is intended to be compatible with Python 3.7 and above (although
we have tried to be compatible with Python 3.6 when possible).

We have added a few *optional* dependencies that can improve the feedback
generated. All of these dependencies should work in almost any Python
environment, however.

You should also refer to the :doc:`integrations`
